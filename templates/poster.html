    <h1>Poster</h1>
    <div class="task">
        <h2>0-GET</h2>
        <p>
            I forked the repo on GitHub and then installed VSCode so I could edit and keep track of changes,
            after correcting an error I was able to access the source code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once I installed VSCode and ran the automated file given to me, unfortunately I kept getting an error
            saying that the connection could not be established to the linux server. After digging aroudn in VSCode logs, 
            I noticed that an error kept popping up about a file not existing. I saw the path it kept trying to
            access, the program wanted to access and/or create an ssh key. So I created an empty 'config' file 
            on my local '.ssh' folder and added this path to VSCode's settings. This then allowed me to login 
            into the linux server after entering my password.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
        <h2>0-RUN Get app running and view it in a browser</h2>
        <p>
            I installed the requirements, then ran the 'app.py' file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once I was able to access the source code, I could then install the necessary requirements Python needed in
            order to run the entire app. Installation was straightforward and ran into no errors. Once that was done,
            I was able to run the 'app.py' file successfully and was able to display the webserver in my own browser. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
        <h2>0-CHANGE Make a change to a template and see it appear</h2>
        <p>
            I added a a button to the home webpage to redirect to the page of this 'poster' and the 'info' page. 
            I was then able to make my first commit and push it to the my GitHub repo.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
        <h2>1-TEMPLATE Add a new template to the app</h2>
        <p>
            Info html file edited to display INFO.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
      <h2>1-TEMPLATE Add a new template to the app</h2>
      <p>
        I added a button to home page which redirected to new 'info.html'. This page is an almagamation of all tables
        in the buggy server INFO page, the app scrapes the page in real time and renders it 'on-the-fly'. To do this,
        I installed the BeautifulSoup python library which is used to parse and navitage HTML files/webpages. 
        After only scraping sections of the webpage and removing the first (as this table only shows info regarding
        defaul values which were not needed). After which, I could then pass the tables as an argument to 'render_template'.
        But before they could be rendered, I had to edit the file stating that they were 'safe', as Flask, by default, assumes 
        all texts are 'unsafe' and not to be rendered as HTML, instead showing it as text.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
        <h2>1-ADD Add more data to the form/1-VALID Add basic data validation</h2>
        <p>
          I made the form as a table so that I could add rows for user to input information. With each correspoding attribute,
          I made sure the right type of data was being inupt, e.g., for integers I made sure to add to the HTMl 
          page that the type was 'number' and could only add in steps of '1' - ensuring only integers could be used as input. 
          Next, I also made sure to code in constraints, for example certain integers had to be at least 0 or 1, so I added a min attribute.
          Or when the input could only be a selection, so I coded for only specific options avaiable, instead of simple adding a text box
          through which incorrect inputs could be added. Of course, all of this is client-side form validation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was able to add further constratint which relate to another form input, the number of tyres needing to be equal to or greater than
          the number of wheels. I was able to add this by adding javascript to the HTML file and running it when the submit button was
          clicked. An error message window pops up if this constraint is not met.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="task">
        <h2>
            1-VALID Add basic data validation
        </h2>
        
        <p>
