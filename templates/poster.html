        <h2>0-GET</h2>
        <p>
            I forked the repo on GitHub and then installed VSCode so I could edit and keep track of changes,
            after correcting an error I was able to access the source code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once I installed VSCode and ran the automated file given to me, unfortunately I kept getting an error
            saying that the connection could not be established to the linux server. After digging aroudn in VSCode logs, 
            I noticed that an error kept popping up about a file not existing. I saw the path it kept trying to
            access, the program wanted to access and/or create an ssh key. So I created an empty 'config' file 
            on my local '.ssh' folder and added this path to VSCode's settings. This then allowed me to login 
            into the linux server after entering my password.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
        <h2>0-RUN Get app running and view it in a browser</h2>
        <p>
            I installed the requirements, then ran the 'app.py' file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once I was able to access the source code, I could then install the necessary requirements Python needed in
            order to run the entire app. Installation was straightforward and ran into no errors. Once that was done,
            I was able to run the 'app.py' file successfully and was able to display the webserver in my own browser. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
        <h2>0-CHANGE Make a change to a template and see it appear</h2>
        <p>
            I added a a button to the home webpage to redirect to the page of this 'poster' and the 'info' page. 
            I was then able to make my first commit and push it to the my GitHub repo.
        </p>
    </div>
